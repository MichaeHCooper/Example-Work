These are the key and final peices of code for my dissertation.  In reality my code went through an enormous number
of revesions with these selection of files representing the final set of networks and data genertation.

This is the abstract of my dissertation to summarise my work.

"The research used a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the YOLO network (J. Redmon S. D., 2016),
to decompose arbitrary floorplans into rectangles.  This was done to move further towards automated structural design;
previously this has only been achieved on rectangular or rectilinear structures.  This research now provides a method
using CNNâ€™s which allows for a much wider range of structures to be automatically designed, by simplifying arbitrary
floorplans into a set of rectangular segments, which can already have the structure automatically designed.  As
an offshoot, the research finds a method of solving the general problem of decomposing images in to low order shapes."
