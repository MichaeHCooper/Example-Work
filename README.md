# Example Software Projects
Examples of my coding work to any prospective employers.  I've got most of the key software projects I've done now uploaded, theres still a bit more to do, specifically I'll try and upload my work related to my raspberry pi speed tester and a nice picture of the hardware!

I've also uploaded some of my engineering design work for anyone interested in my structural engineering capabilities as I've linked my git to my CV.

If you want to try a program the best one would be the demo for my dissertation, this one is the easiest to set up.
